-- Omni Account: private "avatars" bucket for profile pictures.
-- Non-destructive and idempotent. NOT applied automatically: run it once in the
-- Supabase SQL editor (or `supabase db push`) for the shared "Omni Apps" project.
--
-- Design:
--  * Bucket is PRIVATE; the app serves pictures through short-lived signed URLs.
--  * Objects live at  avatars/<auth.uid()>/<file>.  Users can only touch their own folder.
--  * 2 MB limit and image-only MIME types are enforced server-side, not just in the UI.
--  * Profile fields themselves stay in auth.users.user_metadata, so no new table is needed.
